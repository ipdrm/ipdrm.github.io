## Overview

Node architectures of extreme-scale systems are rapidly increasing in complexity. Emerging homogeneous and heterogeneous designs provide massive multi-level parallelism, but developing efficient runtime systems and middleware that allow applications to efficiently and productively exploit these architectures is extremely challenging.  Moreover, current state-of-the-art approaches may become unworkable once energy consumption, resilience, and data movement constraints are added. The goal of this workshop is to attract the international research community to share new and bold ideas that will address the challenges of design, implementation, deployment, and evaluation of future runtime systems and middleware.

## Topics

This workshop will emphasize novel, disruptive research ideas over incremental advances. We will solicit papers on topics including, but not limited to, the following areas:

### Runtime System/Middleware Design, Evaluation and Usage
* Runtime/Middleware for emerging HPC and cloud computing platforms
* Runtime/Middleware for Big Data Computing
* Modeling and Performance Analysis of Runtime Systems
* Comparison studies of different runtime systems and middleware
* Tuning and Optimization studies
* Interactions between Runtime Systems and Middleware
* Runtime-architecture co-design

### Constraints and Issues for Runtime Systems and Middleware
* Energy- and Power-aware schemes
* Fault Tolerance and Reliability
* Scalable high-performance I/O and access to Big Data
* Memory management
* Runtime data analysis (e.g., in-situ analysis)
* Real-time solutions and QOS
* Virtualization, provisioning, and scheduling
* Scalability of novel runtime systems and applications using them

### Design Principles and Programming Support
* High-level programming models (e.g., thread and task based models, data parallel models, and stream programming) and domain-specific languages
* Programming frameworks, parallel programming, and design methodologies
* Methodologies and tools for runtime and middleware design, implementation , verification, and evaluation
* Wild and crazy ideas on future Runtime System and Middleware

## Submissions

We invite two kinds of submissions to this workshop: (1) Full-length research papers (8-page limit); (2) Short papers (4-page limit), which can take the form of position papers, experience reports, or surveys/comparisons of runtime systems and middleware. Papers should not exceed eight (or four) single-spaced pages (including figures, tables and references) using 10-point font on 8.5x11-inch pages. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, presentation quality, and appropriateness. Submitted papers should not have appeared in or under consideration for another venue. A full peer-review process will be followed with each paper being reviewed by at least 3 members of the program committee.

Submissions should follow the IEEE Conference Proceedings templates found at ([http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html](http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html)). Camera-ready copy will need to conform to IPDPS guidelines; these will be announced during author notification

## Keynote

### Title
Memory Centric Optimization: Keep the memory hierarchy but nothing else

### Abstract
Computing has changed from compute-centric to data-centric. Many new architectures, such as GPU, FPGA, ASIC, are introduced to match computer systems with the applicationsâ€™ data requirement, and therefore, improve the overall performance. In this talk we introduce a series of fundamental results and their associated mechanisms to conduct this matching automatically, and through both hardware and software optimizations.  We first present the Concurrent-AMAT (C-AMAT) data access model to unify the impact of data locality, concurrency and overlapping. Then, we introduce the pace matching data-transfer design methodology to optimize memory system performance. Based on the pace matching design, a memory hierarchy is built to mask the performance gap between CPU and memory devices. C-AMAT is used to calculate the data transfer request/supply ratio at each memory layer, and a global control algorithm, named layered performance matching (LPM), is developed to match the data transfer at each memory layer and thus match the overall performance between the CPU and the underlying memory system. The holistic pace-matching optimization is very different from the conventional locality-based system optimization. Analytic results show the pace-matching approach can minimize memory-wall effects. Experimental testing confirms the theoretical findings, with a 150x reduction of memory stall time. We will present the concept of the pace matching data transfer, the design of C-AMAT and LPM, and some experimental case studies. We will also discuss optimization and research issues related to pace matching data transfer and of memory systems in general.
